This plugin disables also the "recommend to a friend link" and the "recommend to a friend form" from frontend."           <br>
                                                                                                                          <br>
By default, Joomla! has no option to disables these, because it comes from locked com_mailto component.                   <br>
It's possible to disable mailto function for each article, but not globally by simply disabling com_mailto.               <br>

Here that Disable MailTo Plugin helps. It allows the activation and deactivation of the component by plugin settins.      <br>
By default, com_mailto will be disabled. Just need to install Disable MailTo, it´s all, simple and effective ;)           <br>
